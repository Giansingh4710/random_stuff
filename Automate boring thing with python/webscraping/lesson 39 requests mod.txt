The Requests module is a third-party module for downloading web pages and files.
requests.get() returns a Response object.
The raise_for_status() Response method will raise an exception if the download failed.
You can save a downloaded file to your hard drive with calls to the iter_content() method.

exp: 
import requests
akj=requests.get('https://akj.org')
akj.raise_for_status #if nothing happens, then all good
len(akj.text)#will give you lenght

#when opening file must write in 'wb'(write binary')

file=open('C:\\Users\\gians\\desktop\\anthing.txt','wb')
for i in akj.iter_content(100000):
	file.write(i)
file.close()
